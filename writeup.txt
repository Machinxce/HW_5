GUI I

The goal of this assignment was to implement additional experience
working with the jQuery UI and to pull together much of what weâ€™ve
been doing throughout the semester. we implemented a bit of the
game of Scrabble using drag-and-drop. The idea is to display one
line of the Scrabble board (one line sample) to the user along with
seven letter tiles on a tile rack. The user then drags tiles to the board
to make a word, and you are to report his or her score, taking the letter
values and bonus squares into consideration.

Implemented features
When starting the game the playeris met with random order of tiles they can select from
The player can drag the tiles from the rack into the boxes highlighted in the pink below 
to form a word of their choosing. The box were the letters are dragged and dropped then 
calculates the points according to the value they hold. the single line is also
made so that it recognizes the letters plces and reiterate the spelled word and the 
score associated with it. The game allows for the player to start a new game when they
hit the new game button. Once the player picks a word,they have the option to submit the word,
and to record  their points. Once thats done new letters are placed  on the rack. 
while that is happening the game also accounts for the numbers of tiles remaining.
while I have these features working my dictonary word dectection is not working the way 
it is supposed to.
